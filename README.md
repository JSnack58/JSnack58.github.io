# About Me

* Anthony Frank
* Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, SJSU

I’m a University of California Graduate with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I’ve been passionate about programming since high-school robotics, and chose to pursue CS Bachelors at UC Santa Cruz. There I built a website for Researchers, trained AI Agents, and interned at NVIDIA. Right after taking my degree, I accepted a Software job at Google where I experienced new technologies being developed. Invigorated to join in this development, I’m now pursuing a Masters in A.I. and Data Science.
