# About Me

I'm a Masters student at San Jose State University studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I previously was Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz where I built a website for Researchers, trained AI Agents, and interned at NVIDIA AI for Gaming Team. After earning my Bachelor's I worked at Google as a Cloud Software Engineer and later moved toward FullStack Software Engineering and AI.
